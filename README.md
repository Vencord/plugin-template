# Vencord Plugin Template

This is not usable for now. Gotta finish https://github.com/Vendicated/Vencord/pull/951 first

## Prerequisites 

Install git, node and pnpm

## QuickStart

- Click "Use this template" (not enabled for now cause unfinished)
- Clone your repo via `git clone yourrepo` and cd into it
- (Optional) Edit config.json to add your Vencord location. This enables auto deploy
- Install dependencies: `pnpm i`
- You can now build the example plugin via `pnpm build`

## Next Steps

Edit the example plugin to do what you want it to do

To create more plugins, just create a new folder in plugins/

To publish finished plugins [TODO]
